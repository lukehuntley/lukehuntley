## :memo: metadata 

From electrical engineering to data engineering, I am an engineer who brings problem-solving, analytical thinking, and a drive for continuous improvement to deliver robust solutions. With these traits and a strong foundation in modern data practices, I design, develop, and maintain data solutions. I enjoy working in dynamic environments where I can leverage diverse cloud tools, continuously learn, and collaborate with colleagues. When Iâ€™m not working, I enjoy attending data related Meetups, bashing around with radio-control cars and playing real time strategy games.
